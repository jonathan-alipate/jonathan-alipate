### Hi there, welcome to my Github profile ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸš¶ I am a developer with a curiosity and passion for problem solving. Programming is a superpower, and it allows regular folk like myself to build solutions to the problems that we face on a day to day basis.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on sharpening and my database/API and Node.js skills by attempting to build an automated trading bot.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about how to build DAPPS (Decentralised Applications) using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything and everything.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for book recommendations on the topic of programming architectures.
